# v0.3 rewrite

# Threads

Probably want a thread task/worker model like the simple one outlined in the Rust Book:
  (https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch16-00-concurrency.html)
  (https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch20-02-multithreaded.html)


- main event loop:
  - holds all WM state
  - responds to EventActions received on a channel

- X -> EventAction
  - polls the X server for events and maps them EventActions
  - EventActions are sent to the main thread for processing

- Binding / Hook / User threads
  - Run as part of a thread pool
  - Instead of getting a ref to the manager itself, a handle is given
    that can communicate with the main thread in an opaque way.

## User facing methods
Top level, user facing methods then all follow a similar pattern:
  - Construct a new channel for receiving the result
  - Send the EventAction to the main thread
  - Wait for the result and return it

```rust
struct WmHandle {
    tx: Sender<EventAction>,
}

impl WmHandle {
    pub fn rotate_clients(&self, d: Direction) -> Result<()> {
        let (tx, rx) = channel();
        self.tx.send(EventAction::RotateClients(d, Some(tx)))?;
        rx.recv()?;

        Ok(())
    }
}
```

Within the main thread, the existing methods would then exist as cut down functions
that simply operate on the current WM state.

// Actually...do we only need to track a SINGLE focused client? I think we do...

struct Client {
    id: Xid,
    ws: usize,
    ws_index: usize,
    meta: ClientMeta,
}

struct Screen {
    r: Rect,
    ws: usize,
}

struct Workspace {
    name: String,
    l_active: usize,
    layouts: Vec<Layout>,
}

The issue will be with testing: having to spawn threads to test these methods would
be a pain in the neck but maybe it can all be done with E2E style tests using an
E2E impl of XConn that can be set up in a simple way to stub out the trait and provide
dummy results?



## Things are too complicated at the moment

State wise we are looking at the following:
```rust
struct WindowManager<X>
where
    X: XConn
{
    conn: X,  // ???
    state: State {
        config: Config {
            workspaces: Vec<String>,
            floating_classes: Vec<String>,
            focused_border: Color,
            unfocused_border: Color,
            border_px: u32,
            gap_px: u32,
            main_ratio_step: f32,
            show_bar: bool,
            top_bar: bool,
            bar_height: u32,
        },
        clients: Clients {
            inner: HashMap<Xid, Client>,
            focused_client_id: Option<Xid>,
            focused_border: Color,
            unfocused_border: Color,
        },
        screens: Screens {
            inner: Ring<Screen>,
            bar_height: u32,
            top_bar: bool,
        },
        workspaces: Workspaces {
            inner: Ring<Workspace>,
            previous_workspace: usize,
            client_insert_point: InsertPoint,
            main_ratio_step: f32,
        },
    },
    hooks: Cell<Vec<Box<dyn Hook<X>>>>,
    error_handler: Box<dyn FnMut(PenroseError) -> ()>
}
```

There is a little bit of duplication (easily sorted out) but then all of the top level functionality
in the `WindowManager` itself is implemented as multiple layers wrapping one another which actually
need to bounce around between one another which makes it hard to keep things isolated.


## A new approach
- Top level event loop that is initialised with the above state
- No more WindowManager struct
- Top level functions that operate on the state which are then easily testable

- Internal state needs maintaining along with invariants in relation to the XServer state.
